{"name":"ec2metadata","body":"# ec2metadata ![project status](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2208502/maintained.png)\r\n\r\nAn nodejs API wrapper for the AWS EC2 metadata: [aws userguide](http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/index.html?AESDG-chapter-instancedata.html)\r\n\r\n## Installation with npm\r\n\r\n    $ npm install ec2metadata\r\n\r\n## A smart introduction to EC2 Metadata API\r\n\r\nAmazon EC2 instances can access instance-specific metadata as well as data supplied when launching the instances. This data can be used to build more generic AMIs that can be modified by configuration files supplied at launch time.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you run web servers for various small businesses, they can all use the same AMI and retrieve their content from the Amazon S3 bucket you specify at launch. To add a new customer at any time, simply create a bucket for the customer, add their content, and launch your AMI.\r\n\r\nMetadata is divided into categories. For a list of the categories, see Appendix B: [Metadata Categories](http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/index.html?instancedata-data-categories.html).\r\n\r\n### Data Retrieval\r\n\r\nAn instance retrieves the data by querying a web server using a Query API. The base URI of all requests is http://169.254.169.254/latest/.\r\n\r\n### Security of Launch Data\r\n\r\nAlthough only your specific instance can access launch data, the data is not protected by cryptographic methods. You should take suitable precautions to protect sensitive data (such as long lived encryption keys).\r\n\r\n__You are not billed for HTTP requests used to retrieve metadata and user-supplied data.__\r\n\r\n### Metadata Retrieval\r\n\r\nRequests for a specific metadata resource returns the appropriate value or a 404 HTTP error code if the resource is not available. All metadata is returned as text (content type text/plain).\r\n\r\nRequests for a general metadata resource (i.e. an URI ending with a /) return a list of available resources or a 404 HTTP error code if there is no such resource. The list items are on separate lines terminated by line feeds (ASCII 10).\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nEC2Metadata.get([Array|String], Function);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe first parameter is an array of fields, the second one the complete callback.\r\nEC2Metadata will request all the fields and call the callback at the and.\r\nYou can retrieve a complete list of fields skipping the first parameter of the get function.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar EC2Metadata = require('ec2metadata');\r\n\r\nEC2Metadata.get(function(err, data){\r\n    console.log(JSON.stringify(data, null, '   '));\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nwill output:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n[\r\n   \"amiid\",\r\n   \"ami-launch-index\",\r\n   \"ami-manifest-path\",\r\n   \"block-device-mapping/\",\r\n   \"hostname\",\r\n   \"instance-action\",\r\n   \"instance-id\",\r\n   \"instance-type\",\r\n   \"kernel-id\",\r\n   \"local-hostname\",\r\n   \"local-ipv4\",\r\n   \"mac\",\r\n   \"network/\",\r\n   \"placement/\",\r\n   \"public-hostname\",\r\n   \"public-ipv4\",\r\n   \"public-keys/\",\r\n   \"reservation-id\",\r\n   \"security-groups\"\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can use each field as query, the callback data object will contains all the requested\r\nfields with a camel case converted name.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nEC2Metadata.get(['public-hostname', 'local-ipv4', 'instance-id'], function(err, data){\r\n\r\n    if(err){\r\n        console.log('Something went wrong: ' + err.message);\r\n        return;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    console.log(data.publicHostname);\r\n    console.log(data.localIpv4);\r\n    console.log(data.instanceId);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nA request the name of which does not end with a slash, will populate the data object with a string.\r\nA request the name of which ends with a slash, will populate the data object with an Array.\r\n\r\n## Tests\r\n\r\nIn order to run tests, you must deploy on a amazon ec2 instance and run `npm install`.\r\n\r\n    $ npm test\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\n_This software is released under the MIT license cited below_.\r\n\r\n    Copyright (c) 2010 Kilian Ciuffolo, me@nailik.org.
